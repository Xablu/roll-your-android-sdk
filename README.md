# roll-your-android-sdk
Roll your own Android SDK from the command-line.

This script makes it possible to create a ready-to-go Android SDK from the command line.
It can be run on both macOS and Linux.

Target SDK's for macOS, Linux and Windows can be created by appending the platform on the command line:

`./build_sdk macosx`

The end result is a zipped Android SDK that is ready for usage, without additional configuring required.
